Make two buttons (1) `checkout` and (2) `confirm order`

When user clicks `checkout`, use Stripe API to create/update a new payment intent (in the backend). 
This also creates a client secret that is later sent to Stripe API to confirm payments. (I don't think client secret should be exposed to the frontend)

Create an <Elements> Stripe component and in there include some of Stripe's elements. For example, you can use <PaymentElement/> to embed a payment.
Use `const elements = useElements();` to reference the elements that you created and pass them into stripe.confirmPayment()
After loading stripe, you can use it within <Elements> using `const stripe = useStripe();`

You can use webhooks to Stripe notify you back when it is done doing whatever task it was doing, for example finished with stripe.confirmPayment().
The webhook could call another one of your backend endpoints to finish processing the order

To use webhooks locally, you must install and setup the Stripe CLI. Instructions are found in the webhooks dashboard on stripe.com
